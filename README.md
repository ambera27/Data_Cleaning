# Tidy Data Set Processing Script in R
  By Amber Arriaga (amber.arriaga3@gmail.com)


# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an R script for tidying the data of the UCI's "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set."

The R script "run_analysis.R" will essentially run through the following outlined steps. 

   1) Merge all of the training and testing sets to create one master data set.
   2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
   4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5) Create a new independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
The output files from step 4 "har_data.txt" and step 5 "final_data.txt" are also included in the Data_Cleaning folder.
